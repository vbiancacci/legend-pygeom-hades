# Configuration

It is necessary to provide a configuration YAML file.

This should have a format similar to:

```yaml
source_position:
  phi_in_deg: 0.0
  r_in_mm: 86.0
  z_in_mm: 3.0
lead_castle_idx: 1
```

It describes the which source positions and which lead castle was used.

The different measurements are described on

(note this is a private page).
