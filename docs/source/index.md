# Welcome to pygeomhades's documentation!

Python package containing the Monte Carlo geometry implementation of the LEGEND
HPGe characterization test stand in HADES.

This geometry can be used as an input to the
[remage](https://remage.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) simulation software.

This package is based on {doc}`pyg4ometry <pyg4ometry:index>`,
{doc}`legend-pygeom-hpges <legendhpges:index>` (implementation of HPGe
detectors) and {doc}`legend-pygeom-tools <pygeomtools:index>`.

## Installation

:::{important}

For using all its features, this package requires a working setup of
[`legend-metadata`](https://github.com/legend-exp/legend-metadata) (_private
repository_) before usage. A limited public geometry is also implemented.

:::

The latest tagged version and all its dependencies can be installed from PyPI:
`pip install legend-pygeom-hades`.

Alternatively, the packages's development version can be installed from a git
checkout: `pip install -e .` (in the directory of the git checkout).

## Usage as CLI tool

After installation, the CLI utility `legend-pygeom-hades` is provided on your
`$PATH`. This CLI utility is the primary way to interact with this package. For
now, you can find usage docs by running `legend-pygeom-hades -h`.

In the simplest case, you can create a usable geometry file with:

```
$ legend-pygeom-hades hades.gdml
```

## Extra metadata

Some additional metadata is needed to describe the vaccuum cryostat test stand
geometry. This is described in {doc}`metadata`.
